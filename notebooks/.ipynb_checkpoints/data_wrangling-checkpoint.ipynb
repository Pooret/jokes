The doctor reaches into his cabinet and fishes out a mild laxative.   \"Here, Chief, take 1 teaspoon of this every 3 hours, and come back and see me in two days.\"   The chief took the little bottle, and left back to his village.   Two days later, ask the Doctor requested, he's back.   \"Chief Walking Horse, have you moved yet?\"   The chief slowly shakes his head no.   \"OK, Chief, I'm going to have you double that dosage. I want you to take 2 teaspoons every 3 hours.\"   The chief nods his head yes, and leaves to return to his village.   This repeats itself a couple more times, and the Doctor is growing very concerned. Finally, out of frustration, he grabs another bottle of laxative, and tells the chief to drink the whole thing.   A few days later, while visiting a close by settlement, the Doctor sees the Chief.   \"Chief Walking Horse! It is good to see you. Tell me, have you moved yet?\"   The chief looks at him with a grimace and says. \"Chief Moved yesterday. Teepee full of shit!\"  \n",

       "700  There once was a man who was always lost. He would buy a map at any cost. One day on a trip, he heard his map rip, so into a trashcan, he tossed.   He wandered and wandered with no aim. He started to think it was a game. But with no end in sight and quickly losing light, he started back the way he came.   He cried and threw his hands in the air; he screamed and shouted with despair. \"Could anyone help?\" Then he started with a yelp. There was another man, but trust him, he dare?   \"I gotchu,\" the man said with a grin. \"Come on, I'll help you, hop in.\" He got in his car, they drove pretty far: for the traveler, it seemed a big win.   The driver took the man to a club: he assumed there'd be a phone at a pub. So, in the men went, and a message to his wife, the traveler sent. Then at a deli next door, they ordered a sub.   Suddenly thirsty, the traveler got, so back to the club for drinks, he sought. He was bad at navigating, the driver was hating, but he pressed on, getting lost quite a lot.   At last, he found the club just fine, but he didn't want a beer or wine. He pushed through the crowd, and yelled out quite loud, \"Hey man, where's the punchline?\"  "

Colonel McDowell chooses this distance to be from his toe to the edge of his longest hair on his head and the result is 72 inches, so that means he gets $7,200,000. Colonel Smith chooses the reach of his arms, that is from the tip of his right index finger to the tip of his left index finger, which results in a distance of 75 inches (so he gets $7.5M). Finally Colonel McConaughey chooses the distance from the tip of his penis to his balls -\"*Colonel, choose two parts that are more separated, you'll win more money that way!*\" - says the soldier in charge of the measurement. -\"*No, i'm sure these are the parts i want measured, please proceed!*\" - answers the colonel. The soldier then proceeds to take the measuring tape from the tip of colonel's dick and stretches the tape to reach the balls when suddenly he stops and asks \"*Wait...where are your balls*?!\" -\"*I lost them in Vietnam*\"  \n",

Colonel McDowell chooses this distance to be from his toe to the edge of his longest hair on his head and the result is 72 inches, so that means he gets $7,200,000. Colonel Smith chooses the reach of his arms, that is from the tip of his right index finger to the tip of his left index finger, which results in a distance of 75 inches . Finally Colonel McConaughey chooses the distance from the tip of his penis to his balls -\"*Colonel, choose two parts that are more separated, you'll win more money that way!*\" - says the soldier in charge of the measurement. -\"*No, i'm sure these are the parts i want measured, please proceed!*\" - answers the colonel. The soldier then proceeds to take the measuring tape from the tip of colonel's dick and stretches the tape to reach the balls when suddenly he stops and asks \"*Wait...where are your balls*?!\" -\"*I lost them in Vietnam*\"  \n",
