    "Our raw data is truly unruly, being sourced from the [r/Jokes subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/), and so will require a fair bit of wrangling to get into a useable form. Part of the challenge is that the relevent information we are looking to isolate (the joke and punchline) are within a sea of noisy data; raw internet data tends to be replete with odd characters, emojis, hmtl character references, links, mispellings, null values, and user edits that mask the useful data, making the data more unruly and harder to work with. I will thus be proceeding carefully by closely examing the data during cleaning and making judicious use of test cases to ensure that I am getting the results I expect."

The doctor reaches into his cabinet and fishes out a mild laxative.     \"Here, Chief, take 1 teaspoon of this every 3 hours, and  come back and see me in two days.\"     The chief took the little bottle, and left back to his village.     Two days later, ask the Doctor requested, he's back.     \"Chief Walking Horse, have you moved yet?\"     The chief slowly shakes his head no.     \"OK, Chief, I'm going to have you double that dosage.  I want you to take 2 teaspoons every 3 hours.\"     The chief nods his head yes, and leaves to return to his village.     This repeats itself a couple more times, and the Doctor is growing very concerned.  Finally, out of frustration, he grabs another bottle of laxative, and tells the chief to drink the whole thing.     A few days later, while visiting a close by settlement, the Doctor sees the Chief.     \"Chief Walking Horse!  It is good to see you.  Tell me, have you moved yet?\"     The chief looks at him with a grimace and says. \"Chief Moved yesterday. Teepee full of shit!\"  \n",

Colonel McDowell chooses this distance to be from his toe to the edge of his longest hair on his head and the result is 72 inches, so that means he gets $7,200,000.  Colonel Smith chooses the reach of his arms, that is from the tip of his right index finger to the tip of his left index finger, which results in a distance of 75 inches (so he gets $7.5M).  Finally Colonel McConaughey chooses the distance from the tip of his penis to his balls  -\"*Colonel, choose two parts that are more separated, you'll win more money that way!*\" - says the soldier in charge of the measurement.  -\"*No, i'm sure these are the parts i want measured, please proceed!*\" - answers the colonel. The soldier then proceeds to take the measuring tape from the tip of colonel's dick and stretches the tape to reach the balls when suddenly he stops and asks \"*Wait...where are your balls*?!\"  -\"*I lost them in Vietnam*\"  \n",

Colonel McDowell chooses this distance to be from his toe to the edge of his longest hair on his head and the result is 72 inches, so that means he gets $7,200,000.  Colonel Smith chooses the reach of his arms, that is from the tip of his right index finger to the tip of his left index finger, which results in a distance of 75 inches .  Finally Colonel McConaughey chooses the distance from the tip of his penis to his balls  -\"*Colonel, choose two parts that are more separated, you'll win more money that way!*\" - says the soldier in charge of the measurement.  -\"*No, i'm sure these are the parts i want measured, please proceed!*\" - answers the colonel. The soldier then proceeds to take the measuring tape from the tip of colonel's dick and stretches the tape to reach the balls when suddenly he stops and asks \"*Wait...where are your balls*?!\"  -\"*I lost them in Vietnam*\"  \n",
